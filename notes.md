# Dataset Analysis


# Data Types in Statistics

- qualitive
- quantitive 




### Find mean and median

	describe()

50% percentile is median


#### Usually when the mean and median are close, data is normally distrubed

build a histogram to check if data is distrubed normally or not. (bell curve)




### Find out the quality of your data

- where are the outliers?
	- why are these values out of the ordinary?



What kind of correlation is there between different columns?

	corr()

	- tells you the linear relationship between two columns
	- how one column affects another

> Compare two as a graph using a scatter plot





Define dependent and independent variables

- customer service calls
- account length
- time to talk on the phone



Write a model

- decision tree
	- asking questions until getting to an answer
	- root node, node, leaf


	sklearn library
	DecisionTreeClassifier
	fit()
	trains algorithm

 Evaluate the Algorithm and Test

> create predictions for each one and compare to actual results A full decision tree is never wrong

		- since trained on the same data as we tested on
		- create a test dataset to check actual accuracy
			- can split data to test

# Tools - Dataset Analysis 

jupyter notebook

cocalc - online jupyter notebook



python

> pandas library

> helps analyze and import data

> structured database



Pandas

> primary objects in Pandas are DataFrames

> DataFrames are like tables

> Contain rows and columns of data

> Columns have names

> Rows have index values

> Pandas has easy function for importing and exporting data

> from CSV files, Excel spreadsheets and SQL queries   get snapshot of data

> info()

# Standard Data Science Process


# Business Objective




# Data acquistion

getting data from the company

get data from outside as supplement




# Data analysis and preparation

start analyzing the data and prep the data so you can feed it to the model




# Model

algorithm gives result of who is at risk of leaving




# Evaluation

how accurate is the model?

if inaccurate, get more data/info

- back to data acquisition
	- derivative data: drive more value from the data you have
- tweak model or paramaters




# Implementation





---

# Technologies

CrispDM - framework for datamining used by companies for data science





---

# Hands-on Lab - Machine Learning --- Predicting customer churn


## What is Customer Churn?

> which customer is at the risk of leaving? 

> predict and prevent loss of customer




# Types of Machine Learning


## Supervised

> has labeled data (target variable)

> know who stayed and who left.

> historic data that is labeled

> Types:

> classification - label has different categories

> regression - when output is as continuous numeric value

> Labels are used to train the algorithms


## Unsupervised

> clustering 

> using parameters to create group things together

> no labeled data or not using label data to come up with a solution

> ex) large customer base. making groups of people based off what kind of cars etc
